# 42_PHP_piscine
The PHP Piscine is a month-long bootcamp with the aim to familiarize the candidates with the PHP programming language and the Symfony framework. It spans 10 modules and 2 Rushes.

Note: Due to outdated subjects, modules up to and including Day_04 were made with old versions of PHP (5.6), Composer (2.2), and Symfony (2.8).
